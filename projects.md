For my web development class, I worked with a team to develop a website in React js, using Express for the backend. This website was hosted using DigitalOcean.  
I also created a random number generator using Express js, which outputs and formats the numbers using React js, as well as CSS/ HTML.

In one of the assignments during my computer graphics course, I designed a city building program which llows users to create buildings in a city scene, manipulating location, scaling, and scaling on individual floors of chosen buildings.
