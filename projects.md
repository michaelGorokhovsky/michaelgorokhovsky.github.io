For my web development class, I worked with a team to develop a website in React js, using Express for the backend. This website was hosted using DigitalOcean, but has since been taken down.  
I also created a random number generator using Express js, which outputs and formats the numbers using React js, as well as CSS/ HTML.


## Simple Weather App
### Languages/ frameworks used: HTML/ CSS/ JS

Using vanilla, JS, CSS, and HTML, I developed a simple weather app that will deliver the current weather, and a future forecast for any city entered, and allows the user to swap between Celcius and Farenheit.

In one of the assignments during my computer graphics course, I designed a city building program which llows users to create buildings in a city scene, manipulating location, scaling, and scaling on individual floors of chosen buildings.

## Forming Bonds
### Languages/ frameworks used: Java
![Snapshot2](/img/fobo2.png)

This was developed for around 48 hours as an entry for Ryerson's 2017 Hackathon (RUHacks)  
Theis project is a teaching aid designed to assist with introductory chemistry classes. It allows a user to select from several elements in the periodic table. If they select more than 1 element, the program will determine whether a bond is possible between them. It will then determine the type of bond that will be created and deliver that knowledge to the user.

Explore a city through a camera mounted underneath a drone. The city has collision detection with buildings, as well as other drones that can be destroyed by launching torpedoes at them.
